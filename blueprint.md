# Team Emblem Quiz

This project is a web-based quiz application that tests a user's knowledge of team emblems.

## Current State

The application is a simple quiz page with a question, an image, and multiple-choice answers. The current quiz is about KBO mascots.

## Plan

1.  Replace the KBO mascot quiz data with team emblem quiz data.
2.  Update the images to be team emblems.
3.  Modify the questions and answers to match the new emblems.
